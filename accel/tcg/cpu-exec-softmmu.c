         * can do multiple reconfigurations of the memory map within the
         * critical section, we could potentially accumulate an unbounded
         * collection of memory data structures awaiting reclamation.
         *
         * Because the only thing we're currently protecting with RCU is the
         * memory data structures, it's sufficient to break the critical section
         * in this callback, which we know will get called every time the
         * memory map is rearranged.
         *
         * (If we add anything else in the system that uses RCU to protect
         * its data structures, we will need to implement some other mechanism
         * to force TCG CPUs to exit the critical section, at which point this
         * part of this callback might become unnecessary.)
         *
         * This pair matches cpu_exec's rcu_read_lock()/rcu_read_unlock(), which
         * only protects cpu->as->dispatch. Since we know our caller is about
         * to reload it, it's safe to split the critical section.
